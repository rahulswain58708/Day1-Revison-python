## 📌 What I Did Today

- ✅ Revised **Python Variables & Data Types**
- ✅ Solved **10 Challenging Python Questions**
- ✅ Built **5 Mini Beginner Projects**

This day helped me strengthen core concepts like:
- Variable naming rules
- Data type conversions
- Mutable vs Immutable types
- Identity vs Equality (`is` vs `==`)
- Type errors and dynamic behavior

## 💡 10 Challenging Python Questions

Find them in `challenges_day12.py`:

1. Add int and string without using `int()`
2. Shadowing variables inside a function
3. String multiplication edge cases
4. Boolean traps in conditionals
5. Identity vs equality quiz
6. Implicit type conversion puzzle
7. List reference vs copy confusion
8. Type detection with `type()`
9. Float and string operations
10. `eval()` usage in real-world logic

## 🛠️ 5 Mini Projects

Find them in the `projects/` folder:

| Project Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Calculator | Performs basic math operations |
| Age in Seconds | Converts your age to seconds |
| Student Grade Analyzer | Calculates grades from marks |
| Unit Converter | KM ↔ Miles converter |
| Movie Ticket App | Calculates total ticket cost |

## 🔍 Sample Highlight

```python
a = 5
b = "10"
b = eval(b)  # Using eval() instead of int()
print(a + b)  # Output: 15
